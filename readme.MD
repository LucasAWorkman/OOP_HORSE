# Psuedo

## Classes

### Horse

start by storing 3 int variables, position, tracklength, and the horseID

we can make all three of those protected

like the previous game, store three functions in here, void advance, void printlane, bool iswinner

i could use the same ones from last week but change the logic a little to work with my program

## Race

make ints tracklength and num horses

make an array horse

add a void run which should handle running inside main
